// doubt from 45 and 46 js file 
// i create a variable with var in 45 file and in 46 file i crate the same variable inside a function but i created in  a way that it is created in global scope so when i clg it this variable then it is pritng 45 file variable ( when created with var ) 

// and it printed 46 variable when 45 variable is created with var.

// why
